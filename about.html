      <p>Trish was born after a long carreer in sales finally ended. Patti Lowe initially went to interior design school but after getting caught up chasing a successful carrerr as a business women the design classes shortly ended. It wasn't until she retired was she retired was she finally able to get back into her passion and first calling for art.
  After joining a local Hobby Lobby painting class the skills and talent instantly came back. After having friends and family share her work she had a huge demand for her paintings and commissions. She had to decide how to sign her paintings.
  Patti's loving devoted husband Greg, had always called her Trish when he was completely, and perfectly, and incandescently happy.
  Every painting signed by Trish is made with an outpour of love and happiness. The energy that emits from Trish's work is felt by those who know how kind and happy she is.
  Having a painting by Trish anywhere reminds the viewer of the unconditional love that we share. Her subjects are choosen from a deep root in plenary love and most have love stories behind them, just ask.
